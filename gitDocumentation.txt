Collaborative report writing using Git enables multiple contributors to work together efficiently on a shared document, leveraging version control to track changes and manage updates seamlessly. 
Git allows team members to clone a central repository, make edits locally, and propose changes through pull requests. 
This workflow fosters collaboration by enabling peer review and discussion before merging updates into the 
main branch. Features like branching support parallel development, allowing contributors to experiment 
with ideas without disrupting the main content. Git's history tracking ensures accountability and 
transparency, while its conflict resolution tools help reconcile simultaneous edits. 
By combining these capabilities, Git facilitates an organized, productive, and scalable approach to collaborative report writing.

conclusion:-
 Git helps us to overcome the problems faced during collaboration by providing features to merge the different changes and view the conflicts as well.
